In this data analysis project, I worked with a Covid-19 Dataset to analyze and present the data through a dashboard. The first step involved dividing the dataset into two separate tables using Microsoft Excel. These tables contained the relevant information required for analysis. Once saved, I proceeded to create a SQL database and imported the Excel files into the database.

Next, I executed SQL queries to extract various insights from the dataset. These queries focused on determining global deaths, calculating the percentage of deaths based on continents and countries, determining the percentage of infected individuals based on countries and continents, and calculating the percentage of infected individuals compared to vaccinated individuals. Additionally, I created a permanent view table that would serve as the foundation for data visualization.

The final stage of the project involved using Tableau to create a dashboard. Since I used Tableau Public, I manually converted each of the four SQL queries into separate Excel files for import into Tableau, as direct connection to the SQL database was not possible. By importing these Excel files, I combined a bar chart, a map, a table, and a line graph within the dashboard, effectively presenting the summarized data from the four queries
