This is a data analysis project where i analyzed a Covid-19 Dataset and visualized it into a dashboard. 
the first thing i did was divide the dataset and form two tables that included the info that i needed on excel. 
After saving the two tables, i created a SQL database and imported the excel files into my database.
I ran SQL queries to find out the global deaths, percentage of deaths based on both continent and country, percentage of infected based on country and continent and percentage of infected compared to vaccinated. Lastly, i created a permanent view table that will later be used to visualize the data.
The final step is to visualize the data by creating a dashboard using tableau.I opted to use 4 queries that i thought summarized the most important data. I used tableau public, so i had to manually convert each of my queries into an excel file so that i can import it into tableau since i cant connect it directly to my SQL database.
After importing the 4 excel files (SQL queries) into tableu, i created a dashboard combining a bar chart, a map, a table and a line graph.
